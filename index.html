Olivia waves over to her roommate, <span class="name">Alexis</span>, to sit down.

"Okay, check it out-" she flips her laptop around to reveal a... Pretty sparse looking interface. White screen, rows and rows and rows of text fields listing out things like "Name", "Height", "Species", and a few checkboxes scattered throughout labeled even more concerningly with things like "Self-Reinforcing", "Reality Readjustment", and "Awareness".

"Awareness?" <span class="name">Alexis</span> asked. She'd heard of it before but- "Yeah! Like- Okay, watch this<span class="snaker"></span>." Olivia spins the laptop back around, and after a few keystrokes, <span class="name">Alexis</span> watches in fascination as her roommate's <span id="hair">hair billows out from her head, growing a full foot in a few seconds.</span>
<div id="WarpHair"></div>
"Woah." <span class="name">Alexis</span> breathes.

"I know, right?" Olivia giggles, making a show of flicking her newly flowing locks over her shoulder. "But al<span class="snaker"></span>so, like, we both know that THAT ju<span class="snaker"></span>st happened. But-" she presses a few more buttons and flips the laptop back around.

The interface is now populated with information about none other than Olivia herself, listing out hundreds of factoids. It's mostly everything she'd come to know from her roommate by living with her over the last few years, including her name (Olivia White), species <span id="species">(felis domesticus), fur color (black)</span>, hometown (Mew York), sexual orientation (pansexual), first crush (Justnyan Kittimberlake), social security number (981-0y'know let's skip down a bit), anal circ-

<span class="name">Alexis</span> quickly averts her gaze and Olivia points with a clawed pawfinger to a specific set of checkboxes about halfway down. One is labeled "Awareness, Self" which is checked, and "Awareness, Everyone Else", which is also checked. "So, thi<span class="snaker"></span>s i<span class="snaker"></span>s what I had with the hair, and-" with a press of a button, "Awareness, Self" becomes unchecked. "-now I won't have any idea a change ha<span class="snaker"></span>s happened."

"Wait, seriously? Just like that?" <span class="name">Alexis</span> looked surprised.

"Yeah! Check it." Olivia spins the laptop back around and presses a few buttons. "I could change <span class="snaker"></span>something that would be <span class="snakerCap"></span>SUPER obvious to my<span class="snaker"></span>self-" she says "-like uh... Oh, let'<span class="snaker"></span>s do thi<span class="snaker"></span>s."

<span id=snakerBody1>A resounding clack echoes through the room as the air changes imperceptibly. The change is almost immediate, but not exactly.</span> <span class="name">Alexis</span> <span id=snakerBody2>has just enough time to watch her roommate's arms arms disappear into her torso, her shorts to shoot out underneath the table as her legs clamp together, and her neck thicken as her shoulders smooth away. Glistening fur gives way to glistening scales, just as dark and shiny as her coat was, and her legs? Body? Tail? coils up on the floor beneath the chair she now perches awkwardly in.</span> <span class="name">Alexis</span> <span id=snakerBody3>barely noticed her snout pushing out, the structure of her spine and ribs changing so there's practically no difference between tail, to body, to neck, terminating in a snake head, slitted eyes, and the same goofy smile she'd known all these years.</span>

Olivia, <span id="once">once a cat, now sat before her as an enormous, limbless snake.</span>

<span class="name">Alexis</span> could only stare in awe.
<div id="WarpSpecies"></div>
"Ssssso?" the snake cocked her head.

"Woah! Y-yeah, it worked, you're a snake now!"

Olivia scrunched her nose for a second, "Well, yeah, duh. But like- What changed?"

"No- You- You're a SNAKE. You were a cat like, two seconds ago."

"Oh, oh!" Olivia did odd bouncing motion as she threw her head back and smiled. Was this how snakes laughed? "Right- Yeah. Awarenesssss filter."

"That's crazy..." whispered <span class="name">Alexis</span>, "Are- Are you gonna turn back?"

"What? Into a cat? No thanksss. We've got enough limbsss for one apartment." Again with the bouncing and grinning.

"But- What about our friends? Your clients are gonna notice when their inventor suddenly became a snake without warning."

"Oh relacksss. It'sss ssset up to log all the changesss and ssswap 'em back at midnight. I'll wake up looking like that-" the tip of her tail lifts up to point at <span class="name">Alexis</span> "-and nobody'sss gonna be the wissser."

[things to hit, maybe: lock in place and then breast expand, fuck around with nationality, impose a new template on someone]

"Ooo-kay... So wait- you made it so you're not aware of your OWN changes?" <span class="name">Alexis</span> asked. She'd be more alarmed but... She'd gotten used to Olivia's gung-ho attitude towards massive morphological changes a while ago.
<div id="WarpName"></div>
"Yesss! It'sss got different sssettingsss too- I can dessside that everyone would noticsse, which isss jusst like, regular transssformation oooor... Nobody ekssept me." Olivia hissed as she tapped away on the keyboard.

<span class="name">Kitty</span> wasn't sure if she liked the way her roommate's fangs popped out whenever she grinned like that, and she definitely didn't like that it came after a statement like THAT.

"So you could change anything about anything and nobody would even notice?"

Olivia nodded. "I could even change your name to sssomething boring like 'Alecksisss' and you would believe you'd alwaysss been named that."

<span class="name">Kitty</span>'s head cocked. Alexis? Jeez. She was already kind of a stuffy nerd working at an academic library and having basically no social life outside of her only kind of crazy roommate, she didn't need to /sound/ like one, too. Her name was one of the more fun things about her! She shuddered thinking about having it changed, and even worse, having no idea any change even took place...

Her roommate giggled that snakey giggle again watching her mull over such an idea.
